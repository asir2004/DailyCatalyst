# DailyCatalyst

Hello! I'm Mark, an amateur of iOS App developing. I'm currently following Paul Hudson's Swift Tutorial: Ultimate Portfolio to make this app.

I found I always forget exciting moment after few days it happened, so this will be an app that will support everyday notification, watchface and lockscreen integration to encourage you up.

Thanks for supporting!
